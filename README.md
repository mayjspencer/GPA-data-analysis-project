# GPA Data Analysis Project

## Summary
A tool to manage data from a large file of students including their school, city, state, and grades. 

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- numPy
- matplotlib

## Launch
The project so far is a command line tool.

## Purpose
### College Admissions
The tool was built with college admissions in mind. Each university has different GPA standards in which they base their admissions. This tool breaks down a large file of students across the nation into manageable data for college admissions officers to use.

## Ways to Manage the Student Data

### GPA
High schools often offer two ways of scaling grades: Unweighted and Weighted GPA. Weighted GPAs simply track GPA on a scale that rewards AP (Advanced Placement) class grades. Unweighted GPAs treat all classes with the same scale.

Colleges across the nation vary in their favor for AP classes, so this tool allows admissions officers to manage both values.

### State
Some universities take state percintile into account for their admissions. EX: Ivy League schools often consider students in the top percintile of their state more valuable.

So, the tool offers functionality for viewing students in a certain state and narrowing those down to a certain percintile. 

### School
Some universities take school percintile into account for their admissions. EX: The University of Texas only considers students in the state of Texas if they were in the top percintile of their school.

So, the tool offers functionality for viewing students in a certain school and narrowing those down to a certain percintile.
